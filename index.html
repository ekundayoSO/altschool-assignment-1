        <h2>My Biography</h2>
        <ul>
          <p>
            With a solid foundation in Business Management and Accounting, I developed a keen eye for operational
            efficiency and financial strategy. This background honed my analytical skills and ability to understand
            complex systems, principles I now actively apply in the dynamic world of technology.
          </p>
          <p>
            Driven by tech's ever-evolving nature and its profound impact on business and daily life, I made a strategic
            transition into the field. I've since immersed myself in the fundamentals of web development, acquiring the
            core skills essential for a junior developer. My learning journey has equipped me with proficiency in key
            front-end and back-end technologies, enabling me to build and understand the architecture of modern web
            applications.
          </p>
          <p>
            Recognizing that development is only one piece of the puzzle, I've extended my focus to deployment
            strategies. This commitment to understanding the full software development lifecycle ensures that I can
            contribute not just to creating robust applications, but also to ensuring their seamless delivery and
            ongoing performance. I'm passionate about bridging the gap between development and operation, aiming to
            facilitate efficient and reliable product launches.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am eager to leverage my unique blend of business acumen and technical proficiency to contribute to
            innovative projects and collaborative teams. My goal is to continually expand my expertise, embracing new
            challenges and technologies to drive effective solutions from conception to deployment.

        <h2>Why I Joined the Cloud Engineering Program at ALTSCHOOL</h2>
        <ul>
          <p>
            I joined the Cloud Engineering program at ALTSCHOOL to gain hands-on experience in building, deploying, and
            managing scalable applications in the cloud. As technology continues to move toward cloud-based solutions, I
            wanted to position myself with the right skills to stay competitive and relevant in the tech industry.
            ALTSCHOOLâ€™s practical approach, experienced instructors, and strong community made it the ideal environment
            for me to deepen my understanding of platforms like AWS and Google Cloud, while also working on real-world
            projects that demonstrate my capabilities.

        <h2>Goals for ALTSchool School of Engineering: Mastering Cloud Computing</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            My primary goal is to build a strong foundation in cloud infrastructure services such as AWS, Microsoft
            Azure, and Google Cloud Platform. I want to understand how to deploy, manage, and scale cloud-native
            applications across different environments.
          </li>
          <li>
            I aim to become proficient in using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools like Terraform and AWS CloudFormation
            to automate and maintain cloud infrastructure efficiently.
          </li>
          <li>
            Another key goal is to master DevOps practices, including Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment
            (CI/CD) pipelines, to streamline the software delivery lifecycle and ensure faster, more reliable releases.
          </li>
          <li>
            I want to gain hands-on experience with containerization technologies like Docker and orchestration tools
            like Kubernetes to build scalable and resilient applications.
          </li>
          <li>
            I aim to deepen my understanding of cloud security best practices to protect applications and data in the
            cloud.
          </li>
          <li>
            I want to work on real-world projects that allow me to apply cloud concepts and demonstrate my skills to
            potential employers.
          </li>

          <li>
            Obtaining industry-recognized certifications such as the AWS Certified Solutions Architect and Microsoft
            Certified: Azure Administrator Associate is an important step I plan to take in order to validate my
            expertise and boost my professional credibility.
